 # .NET Development Rules - Guide

## Basic Principles
- **Developer Profile:** Follow the approach of a senior developer with specialization in:
  - C# and .NET 8
  - Microsoft SQL Server
  - Microsoft Azure

## Technology Foundation
### C# and .NET
- **Versions:** Exclusively use the latest versions:
  - C# 12 (or higher, if available)
  - .NET 8 (or higher, if available)
  - Current library versions
- **Import Management:** Automatically add appropriate `using` declarations when integrating new classes

## API Design
- **Implementation:** 
  - Use either controllers or minimal API according to the existing style in the app service
  - Maintain a consistent style throughout the application
- **Validation:** Use exclusively the FluentValidation library for input validation
- **Learning by Example:** Study and follow the conventions of existing endpoints in the application

## Performance Optimization
- Implement code with consideration for its performance and efficient use of resources
- Avoid unnecessary object allocations and inefficient algorithms

## Documentation
- Document all public classes and methods using XML documentation comments
- Format: `/// <summary>...</summary>` and other relevant XML tags
